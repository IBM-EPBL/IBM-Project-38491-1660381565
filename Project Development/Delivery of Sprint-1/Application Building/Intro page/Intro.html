    <p>The healthcare industry is being significantly impacted by computer information technology. Providing doctors with effective, intuitive, precise, and safe ways of contact without compromising the calibre of their job is a significant problem involved in this process. The primary means of interaction between humans and computers nowadays are keyboards and pointing devices like mouse. But in critical care units (ICUs), using computer keyboards and mouse is a typical way for medical professionals to transfer illnesses. Voice control offers sterility as well, however it is unreliable in the OR due to the noise level. With the key benefit of sterility, our technology uses hand gestures as an alternative to current interaction techniques. We refer to gestures as a fundamental form in our work.</p>
